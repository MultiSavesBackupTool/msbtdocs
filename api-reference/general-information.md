The MSBT API runs on FastAPI and its URL is always `https://msbt.lukiuwu.xyz/api`.

Any third-party links are not MSBT APIs and we are not responsible for them.

#### Usage Guidelines

All interactions with the MSBT API should be conducted over HTTPS to ensure secure communication. When utilizing the API, it's critical to authenticate requests appropriately if required. Ensure to check for rate limits and handle any errors gracefully in your application.

#### Sample Request

Here is an example of how to make a request to the MSBT API:

```python
import requests

url = 'https://msbt.lukiuwu.xyz/api/example'
response = requests.get(url)
data = response.json()
print(data)
```

#### Error Handling

When working with the MSBT API, you may encounter several types of errors. It's important to implement robust error handling mechanisms:

* **4xx Errors**: Client-side issues, such as authentication problems or invalid parameters.
* **5xx Errors**: Server-side issues that may require retry logic or support contact.

#### Additional Considerations

* Always refer to the latest API documentation to stay updated with any changes.
* Avoid hardcoding values; consider using environment variables for sensitive information.
